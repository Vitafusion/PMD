Title: Calculate probability density of Poisson Multinomial Distiribution
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Zhengzhi(Alex) Lin
Maintainer: Zhengzhi Lin(zhengzhi@vt.edu)
Description: Using three methods to calculate the densities. They are Multinomial Discrete Fourier Transformation, Normal approximation, and Simulation method. Users just need to input probability matrix to get desired density output.
